            "explanation": "To find the volume of the solid, we first need to understand the shape that is cut out of the sphere. The two parallel planes cut out a section from the sphere, and this section is a ring or a torus (doughnut shape) with two hemispheres cut off at the top and bottom. \n\nThe volume of the solid can be found by first finding the volume of the entire sphere, and then subtracting the volume of the two hemispheres that were cut off. \n\nThe volume of a sphere with radius r is V = (4/3)πr^3. In this case, r = 2, so the volume of the entire sphere is V = (4/3)π(2)^3 = 32π/3.\n\nThe volume of a hemisphere with radius r is V = (2/3)πr^3. In this case, r = 2, so the volume of one hemisphere is V = (2/3)π(2)^3 = 16π/3. Since there are two hemispheres, their total volume is 2 * (16π/3) = 32π/3.\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the solid by subtracting the volume of the two hemispheres from the volume of the entire sphere: 32π/3 - 32π/3 = 0. However, this is not one of the options, so we should re-evaluate our approach. \n\nWhen two hemispheres are cut off from the top and bottom of the torus, the volume of the solid is actually equal to the volume of the torus. The volume of a torus can be found by first finding the volume of a tube with a certain height and then finding the volume of a smaller tube with the same height and then subtracting the volume of the smaller tube from the volume of the larger tube. \n\nHowever, there is a more direct way to find the volume of the torus. The two parallel planes cut out a section from the sphere, and this section is a ring or a torus (doughnut shape) with a radius of 2 and a height of 1. The volume of the torus can be found by V = 2π^2r^2h, where r is the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube, and h is the height of the torus. However, this formula is not provided in the options",

So there are 4 ways to choose the male lead.\n3. Choose the three non-lead roles: Since these roles can be played by either gender, we have 6 members left to choose from (4 females and 2 males).

We can do this by multiplying the number of choices at each step:\n\n4 (ways to choose the female lead) * 4 (ways to choose the male lead) * 20 (ways to choose the three non-lead roles) = 320\n\nHowever, this is not an option. Let's try another approach.
