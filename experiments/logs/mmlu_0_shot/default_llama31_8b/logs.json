So, the coat is marked down by $65 in November. \n   The new price of the coat after the 20% discount is 325 - 65 = $260.\n\n2. 10% of $260 is 0.10 * 260 = $26. So, the coat is marked down by $26 in December. \n   The new price of the coat after the 10% discount is 260 - 26 = $234.\n\nHowever, this is not the final answer. The question states that the December price is the final price that the Christmas shopper would pay. So, we need to find the correct answer from the options. \n\nThe options are A) $227.50, B) $234.00, C) $286.00, D) $290.00. We already know that the coat's price after the 10% discount in December is $234.00, which is option B. But option A) $227.50 is also a possible answer because it is $1 less than option B, which could be due to a rounding error or an additional discount that is not mentioned in the question. \n\nHowever, we can also see that option A) $227.50 is 10% less than option B) $234.00. So, option A) $227.50 is 10% of $234.00, which is $23.40. We can see that option A) $227.50 is indeed 10% less than option B) $234.00, which is the same as the 10% discount in December. \n\nSo, the correct answer is option A) $227.50. \n\nANSWER: A) $227.50. \n\nNote: The question states that the coat did not sell in November, but it does not state that it did not sell in December. However, it is not possible to sell the coat in December at a price that is 10% less than the price in December. So, we can assume that the coat did not sell in December either. \n\nAlso, note that option C) $286.00 and option D) $290.",

            "explanation": "To find the expected number of times Bob will roll his die, we first need to find the probability that he will roll a number other than 1. \n\nIn a six-sided die, there are 6 possible outcomes. Bob will roll again if he rolls a 1, so we need to find the probability that he will not roll a 1. The probability of not rolling a 1 is 1 - (1/6) = 5/6.\n\nNow, we need to find the expected number of times Bob will roll his die in a non-leap year, which has 365 days. \n\nLet X be the number of times Bob will roll his die. We can model X as a geometric distribution with p = 5/6, since the die is rolled until a number other than 1 is obtained. The expected value of a geometric distribution is 1/p = 6/5.\n\nSo, the expected number of times Bob will roll his die in a non-leap year is 365 * (6/5) = 438.\n\nANSWER: D",

            "explanation": "To find the volume of the solid, we first need to understand the shape that is cut out of the sphere. The two parallel planes cut out a section from the sphere, and this section is a ring or a torus (doughnut shape) with two hemispheres cut off at the top and bottom. \n\nThe volume of the solid can be found by first finding the volume of the entire sphere, and then finding the volume of the two hemispheres that are cut off, and then subtracting that from the volume of the entire sphere.\n\nThe volume of a sphere with radius r is (4/3)πr^3. So, the volume of the entire sphere with radius 2 is (4/3)π(2)^3 = (4/3)π(8) = 32/3π.\n\nThe volume of a hemisphere with radius r is (2/3)πr^3. So, the volume of each of the two hemispheres that are cut off is (2/3)π(2)^3 = (2/3)π(8) = 16/3π.\n\nSince there are two hemispheres, their total volume is 2 * (16/3π) = 32/3π.\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the solid by subtracting the volume of the two hemispheres from the volume of the entire sphere: 32/3π - 32/3π = 0. However, this is not an option, so let's consider the 3D shape cut out by the two planes. The 3D shape cut out is a ring or a torus with two hemispheres cut off at the top and bottom. The volume of this 3D shape cut out is a torus with two hemispheres cut off, which is equal to the volume of a torus with a minor radius of 1 and major radius of 2, minus the volume of two hemispheres with radius 1. The volume of the torus with minor radius 1 and major radius 2 is 2π^2(1^2 + 2^2) = 2π^2(5) = 10π^2. The volume of two hemispheres with radius 1 is 2 * (2/3)π(1^3) = 4/3π. So, the volume of the 3D shape cut out is 10",
